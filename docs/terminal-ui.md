# Terminal UI

## Attached Mode

When the CLI is attached to an agent, it takes over the terminal:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ clust  a3f8c1 │ claude │ Ctrl+Q detach             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Bottom Status Bar

The bar is always 1 line tall, pinned to the bottom of the terminal.

**Contents (left to right):**

| Section | Example | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Brand | `clust` | Always shown |
| Agent ID | `a3f8c1` | The 6-char hex ID of the attached agent |
| Agent binary | `claude` | Which agent is running |
| Shortcuts | `Ctrl+Q detach` | Available keyboard shortcuts |

The bar uses a distinct background color (e.g., muted gray/blue) to visually separate it from agent output.

### Rendering Approach

- Put the terminal in **raw mode** (via `crossterm`)
- Reserve the bottom row for the status bar
- Agent PTY output is rendered in the remaining area
- On terminal resize: recalculate layout, redraw bar
- The attached mode status bar is rendered with raw ANSI escape sequences (not ratatui); agent output is passed through directly

### Input Handling

- All keyboard input is forwarded to the agent PTY, **except** recognized clust shortcuts
- Shortcut detection happens first; unmatched input passes through

### Attach Flow

1. CLI sends `AttachAgent { id }` to hub
2. Hub sends the agent's replay buffer contents as `AgentOutput` messages
3. Hub sends `AgentReplayComplete { id }` sentinel
4. Hub begins live-streaming new `AgentOutput` messages
5. CLI enters raw mode, draws status bar
6. During replay (before `AgentReplayComplete`), output is stored in scrollback but suppressed from stdout to prevent a flash of historical content
7. After `AgentReplayComplete`, normal stdout rendering resumes — the agent's own redraw provides a clean screen
8. CLI streams output to terminal, forwards input to hub

### Detach Flow

1. User presses `Ctrl+Q`
2. CLI sends `DetachAgent { id }` to hub
3. CLI exits raw mode, restores terminal
4. CLI exits cleanly (agent continues in hub)

### Background Mode (`-b`)

No terminal takeover. The CLI:

1. Sends `StartAgent` to hub
2. Receives `AgentStarted { id }`
3. Prints the ID to stdout: `Started agent a3f8c1`
4. Exits immediately

## `clust ui` Dashboard

A full terminal UI (TUI) built with `ratatui` + `crossterm`.

### Layout

The dashboard has a top tab bar, two content panels separated by a vertical divider, and a bottom status bar.

#### Tab Bar

A 1-row bar at the top of the terminal with three tabs:

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `Repositories` | Two-panel view with repo tree and agent cards (default) |
| `Overview` | Multi-agent terminal overview with horizontal panels |
| `Focus` | Single-agent focus view with a 40%-width terminal panel on the right |

The active tab is highlighted with the accent color. A `Tab/Shift+Tab` hint is shown to the right of the tabs.

#### Content Panels (Repositories tab)

- **Left panel (40%):** Repository tracker with `(2,2,1,0)` padding. Shows a tree view of registered git repositories with their local and remote branches. Repository names are rendered in Bold using their original case. Tree items have no blank spacer lines between them for a compact layout. Tree connectors use `├──` / `└──` for clear hierarchy. Branch names are rendered Bold. Remote branches are collapsed by default. Branches with active agents display a green `●` indicator with count; branches checked out in worktrees display a `⎇` indicator. The current HEAD branch is highlighted. Displays "No repositories found" when no repos are registered. Uses background colors for visual separation (no borders). The focused panel shows a bright accent dot; the unfocused panel shows a dim dot. Agents not associated with any git repository are grouped under a synthetic "No Repository" entry at the bottom of the tree. This entry has no local/remote category level -- agents are listed directly under the repo node with their binary name and working directory. Navigation skips the category level for this group.
- **Vertical divider (1 col):** A single-column divider between the two panels.
- **Right panel (60%):** Shows agent cards grouped by hub name (or by repo) with section headers, `(2,2,0,0)` padding. 1-line gaps separate agent cards within a group and a 1-line spacer follows each group header. Displays the CLUST logo when no agents are running.

Agent cards show: ID, binary name, status, start time, and attached terminal count.

Repositories are registered via `clust repo -R` or auto-registered when an agent is launched inside a git repo. Branch data is fetched from the local git state every 2 seconds (no network calls or authentication required).

#### Overview Tab

A multi-agent terminal overview that displays all active agents side-by-side with live terminal output. Each agent gets its own panel with a full VTE terminal emulator.

```

**Layout:**

- **Options bar (1 row):** Top row, reserved for future filter buttons. Background changes based on focus.
- **Agent panels (horizontal):** Fixed-width columns sized so exactly 2.5 panels fit across the screen (showing 2 full panels + half of a third), with a minimum width of 40 columns. When more agents exist than fit on screen, horizontal scrolling is enabled with `◀ N` / `N ▶` indicators.
- Each panel has **box-drawing borders** (top, bottom, left, right). The border color is accent blue when the panel is focused, and subtle gray when unfocused.
- Inside the border, a **header row** shows agent ID (accent-colored), separator, agent binary name, and status indicator (`●` green for running, `[exited]` red for exited).
- The **terminal area** below the header renders the agent's PTY output using a VTE-based virtual terminal emulator with full ANSI support (cursor movement, SGR colors/styles, erase operations, scroll regions, line wrapping). The VTE terminal gets the inner width (total panel width minus 2 border columns).

**Focus modes:**

| Focus | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Options Bar | Default. Navigation keys scroll viewport or enter terminal. |
| Terminal(N) | All keyboard input is forwarded directly to the focused agent, except Shift+arrow keys. Focused panel has accent-blue borders; unfocused panels have subtle gray borders. |

**Keyboard shortcuts (Overview tab):**

| Context | Shortcut | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Options Bar | `Shift+↓` | Enter terminal focus (returns to last focused panel) |
| Options Bar | `Shift+←` / `Shift+→` | Scroll viewport left/right |
| Terminal | `Shift+↑` | Return to options bar |
| Terminal | `Shift+←` / `Shift+→` | Switch focus to previous/next agent panel (wraps around) |
| Terminal | `PageUp` / `PageDown` | Scroll focused panel through scrollback history |
| Terminal | Any other key | Forwarded to the focused agent's PTY |

**Implementation:**

- Each agent panel runs a **background tokio task** that maintains its own IPC streaming connection to the hub (attach, receive output, forward input).
- Output events are sent to the UI thread via an `mpsc` channel and drained each frame.
- `VirtualTerminal` wraps a `vte` parser (`vte = 0.13`) and a `Screen` grid that implements `vte::Perform` for full ANSI escape sequence handling. The `Screen` maintains a scrollback ring buffer (default 2,000 lines, configurable via `with_scrollback_capacity()`) of rows that have scrolled off the top of the grid. Scrollback is populated both by natural line scrolling and by `erase_in_display()`, which saves non-blank screen content to scrollback before clearing (for ED modes 2/3, and mode 0 when the cursor is at the home position). This ensures that TUI-style agents that clear the screen with `\x1b[2J` or `\x1b[H\x1b[J` before each redraw accumulate scrollback history. The VirtualTerminal is also used as a shadow terminal in the attached session for scrollback (with 5,000-line capacity), where `resize_keep_scrollback()` preserves scrollback on window resize and `to_ansi_lines_scrolled()` renders scrollback content as ANSI-escaped strings for direct stdout output.
- `key_event_to_bytes()` converts `crossterm::KeyEvent` to raw terminal byte sequences for agent input forwarding.
- Lazy initialization: overview connections are only established on first switch to the Overview tab.
- On connect, each panel's background task consumes the hub's replay buffer before entering the main output loop, so panels show recent history immediately.
- On terminal resize, all panels are resized via `resize_keep_scrollback()` (which preserves accumulated scrollback history) and the hub is notified via `ResizeAgent`. The resize command is sent before clearing the local VTE grid so that a failed send does not leave the grid empty. The VTE grid is cleared on resize (the agent sends a full redraw after receiving SIGWINCH); same-size resizes are skipped as a no-op to preserve content. Resize also resets `current_style` and `wrap_pending` to prevent style bleed. The viewport is scrolled automatically to keep the focused panel visible.
- Each panel has a `panel_scroll_offset` for scrolling through the combined scrollback + live grid. When scrolled, a `↑N` indicator appears in the panel header.
- On exit, all connections are detached and background tasks are aborted.

### Auto-connect

On startup, `clust ui` automatically connects to the hub daemon, starting it if not already running. The bottom status bar shows connection status.

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Status dot | Green `●` when connected, dim when disconnected |
| Status label | `connected` or `disconnected` |
| Shortcuts | Context-aware hints: on Repositories tab shows `q quit`, `Q stop+quit`, navigation hints; on Overview tab shows focus-dependent hints (e.g., `Shift+↓ enter terminal` or `Shift+↑ options`) |

```

**Entry points:**

- **From Overview tab:** While in terminal focus, press `Shift+↓` to open the focused agent in focus mode.
- **From Repositories tab:** While the right panel is focused, press `Enter` on a selected agent to open it in focus mode.

**Exit:** Press `Esc` or `Shift+↑` to return to the previous tab.

**Implementation:**

- `FocusModeState` manages a single `AgentPanel` with its own IPC background task, output channel, and VTE terminal emulator.
- The panel dimensions are calculated as 40% of the content area width (minus borders) by the content area height (minus header).
- All keyboard input is forwarded to the agent except `Esc` (exit), `Shift+↑` (exit), `Shift+PageUp` (scroll up), and `Shift+PageDown` (scroll down).
- On terminal resize, the focus mode panel is resized via `resize_keep_scrollback()` (preserving scrollback history) and the hub is notified via `ResizeAgent`.
- Tab cycling (`Tab` / `Shift+Tab`) skips the Focus tab; it is only entered explicitly via the entry points above.
- On exit, the panel's connection is detached and its background task is aborted.

**Keyboard shortcuts (Focus tab):**

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Esc` | Exit focus mode, return to previous tab |
| `Shift+↑` | Exit focus mode, return to previous tab |
| `Shift+PageUp` | Scroll up through scrollback history |
| `Shift+PageDown` | Scroll down through scrollback history |
| All other keys | Forwarded to the focused agent's PTY |
